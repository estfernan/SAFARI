#' Reconstructed Binary Pathology Slide
#'
#' This reconstructed binary image was first represented as a three-class image,
#' prepared using a tumor recognition system (ConvPath) developed by the
#' Quantitative Biomedical Research Center. The original whole-slide image
#' comes from a lung cancer patient in the Lung Screening Study (LSS)
#' subcomponent of NLST. Specifically, this is an image from an H&E-stained
#' slide that was obtained as part of a pathology specimen collection.
#'
#' @name rBPS
#' @aliases rBPS
#' @docType data
#' @format \code{rBPS} is a 314-by-224 binary matrix where each entry
#' corresponds to a tissue or region in the H&E image. In our case the ones and
#' zeros indicate an empty region or tumor tissue, respectively.
