#' Segmentation Procedure for Binary Images
#'
#' Identify and segment the regions of interest (ROI) in a reconstructed binary
#' image, while having the option to extract quantitative shape-based features.
#'
#' The argument \code{id} specifies the ID's corresponding to the sample.
#' A usual example that is used if the argument is an unnamed vector is composed
#' of the following entries:
#' \itemize{
#'     \item \code{cohort}: name of cohort the sample belongs to;
#'     \item \code{patient.id}: unique identifier for patient the sample belongs to;
#'     \item \code{slide.id}: unique identifier for sample.
#' }
#'
#' The argument \code{filter} specifies how the ROI should be filtered. There
#' are two ways to filter them, either by only specifying a minimum net area or
#' by additionally specifying the \eqn{n} largest regions to keep in a two element
#' vector. The default value is \code{NA} which sets the minimum net area as
#' one-fourth the largest region.
#'
#' The argument \code{categories} specifies the shape features to compute. The
#' default is "none" which computes no features.
#'
#' @section Reconstructed Binary Image:
#'
#' To produce a reconstructed binary image, a greyscale scan or an image easily
#' converted to binary, resulting from different modalities, is converted
#' to a matrix representation, usually by standard image processing algorithms.
#'
#' The resulting matrix is composed of two integer values that help represent the
#' regions of interest in the scan. Usually, as in the case of pathology
#' imaging, these are empty regions and tumor tissues, where we refer to the
#' integer values as categories. We note that the regions of interest must be
#' represented by \code{1}'s and what we consider the empty regions by \code{0}'s.
#'
#' @param x          a binary matrix that represents the reconstructed image.
#' @param id         a named character vector that contains the ID's pertaining to the sample.
#' @param filter     an integer vector that indicates the filtering procedure.
#' @param k          an integer that specifies the factor to enlarge the regions.
#' @param categories a character string or vector, see \code{\link{compute.features}}.
#'
#' @return A \code{list} object whose components are the following:
#' \itemize{
#'     \item \code{desc}:       a \code{data.frame} of the shape features
#'                              corresponding to each segmented ROI;
#'     \item \code{holes}:      an integer matrix that contains the holes within
#'                              each ROI, labeled according to
#'                              the \code{regions};
#'     \item \code{id}:         a character vector that is identical to the
#'                              \code{id} argument passed;
#'     \item \code{k}:          argument \code{k} passed to function;
#'     \item \code{n}:          an integer that indicates the number of
#'                              segmented regions;
#'     \item \code{plg.chains}: a \code{list} where each component is the
#'                              polygonal chain of a segmented ROI;
#'     \item \code{regions}:    an integer matrix that contains the segmented
#'                              ROI, labeled from largest to smallest.
