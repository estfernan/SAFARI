#' Shape Analysis for AI-Reconstructed Images
#'
#' The R package \pkg{SAFARI} provides functions for image processing and
#' shape analysis of regions of interest (ROI) in AI-reconstructed images.
#'
#' The main functions are summarized as follows:
#' \itemize{
#'     \item \code{read.image}: loads and preprocesses reconstructed binary images for segmentation;
#'     \item \code{binary.segmentation}: ROI segmentation and optional feature extraction;
#'     \item \code{compute.features}: feature extraction for an individual ROI;
#'     \item \code{rc.plot}: visualize reconstructed binary or segmented images.
#' }
#'
#' See the package vignettes for more introduction and demonstration.
