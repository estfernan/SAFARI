Description: Provides functionality for image processing and shape analysis in 
    the context of reconstructed medical images generated by deep learning-based
    methods or standard image processing algorithms and produced from different
    medical imaging types, such as X-ray, Computational Tomography (CT),
    Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), and pathology imaging. SAFARI offers tools
    to segment regions of interest and to extract quantitative shape descriptors
    for applications in signal processing, statistical analysis and modeling,
    and machine learning.
